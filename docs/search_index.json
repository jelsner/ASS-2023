You will continue to learn how to code in R, but you will do it in the context of statistical analysis and modeling of spatial data Defining spatial neighborhoods and spatial weights Autocorrelation plays a central role in spatial statistics. It quantifies the degree to which things nearby tend to cluster. Things include values of variables (attributes) aggregated to polygons (or raster cells) as well as the spatial locations of objects. How autocorrelation gets estimated depends on the geometry of the spatial data Things tend to cluster because of: Association: whatever causes an attribute to have a certain value in one area causes the same attribute to have a similar value in areas nearby. Crime rates in nearby neighborhoods might tend to cluster due to similar factors Causality: something within a given area directly influences outcomes within nearby areas. Non-infectious diseases (e.g., lung cancer) have similar rates in neighborhoods close to an oil refinery Interaction: the movement of people, goods or information creates relationships between areas. COVID spreads through areas through the movement of people Spatial statistics focuses on quantifying, and conditioning on, autocorrelation but it is silent about physical causes. Understanding the reason for autocorrelation in your data is important for inference because the causal mechanism might be confounded by its presence. Divorce rates tend to cluster high in southern states, but so does the number of Waffle Houses. Understanding causation requires domain specific knowledge When a variable’s values are aggregated (summed or averaged) to regions, autocorrelation is quantified by calculating how similar a value in region \\(i\\) is to the value in region \\(j\\) and weighting this similarity by how ‘close’ region \\(i\\) is to region \\(j\\). Closer regions are given greater weight High similarities with high weight (similar values close together) yield high values of spatial autocorrelation. Low similarities with high weight (dissimilar values close together) yield low values of spatial autocorrelation. Let \\(\\hbox{sim}_{ij}\\) denote the similarity between values \\(Y_i\\) and \\(Y_j\\), and let \\(w_{ij}\\) denote a set of weights describing the ‘distance’ between regions \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), for \\(i\\), \\(j\\) = 1, …, \\(N\\) A general spatial autocorrelation index (SAI) is given by \\[ \\hbox{SAI} = \\frac{\\sum_{i,j=1}^N w_{ij}\\hbox{sim}_{ij}}{\\sum_{i,j=1}^N w_{ij}} \\] which represents the weighted similarity between regions. The set of weights (\\(w_{ij}\\)) is called a spatial weights matrix. The spatial weights matrix defines the neighbors for each region and defines the strength of each association For cells in a raster under the rook-contiguity criterion, \\(w_{ij}\\) = 1 if cell \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) share a boundary, and 0 if they don’t share a boundary. In this case \\(w_{ij}\\) = \\(w_{ji}\\). Also, a cell is not a neighbor of itself so \\(w_{ii}\\) = 0 Alternatively you can define center locations from a set of polygon regions and let \\(w_{ij}\\) = 1 if the center of region \\(i\\) is near the center of region \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. In this case you need to decide on the number of nearest neighbors You can also define neighbors by distance. For example, if \\(d_{ij}\\) is the distance between centers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), you can let \\(w_{ij}\\) = 1 if \\(d_{ij}\\) &lt; \\(\\delta\\) and 0 otherwise Consider crime data at the tract level in the city of Columbus, Ohio.

The simple feature data frame contains housing values (HOVAL), income values (INC) and (CRIME) in census tracts across the city. Crime (CRIME) is residential burglaries and vehicle thefts per 1000 households. Income (INC) and housing values (HOVAL) are annual values with units of 1000 dollars.

Autocorrelation quantifies the amount of clustering. To compute the autocorrelation you first need to define the neighbors for each polygon You create a list of neighbors using the spdep::poly2nb() function from the {spdep} package. Functions in the {spdep} package support S3 and S4 spatial data objects. The ‘nb’ in the function names stands for neighbor (list) object. The function builds the list from geometries based on contiguity. Neighbors must share a border. By default contiguity is defined as having at least one location along a border common. This is changed by using the argument queen = FALSE if(!require(spdep)) install.packages(&quot;spdep&quot;, repos = &quot;http://cran.us.r-project.org&quot;) ## Loading required package: spdep ## Loading required package: sp ## Loading required package: spData ## Loading required package: sf ## Linking to GEOS 3.10.2, GDAL 3.4.2, PROJ 8.2.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE ( nbs &lt;- spdep::poly2nb(CC.sf) ) ## Neighbour list object: ## Number of regions: 49 ## Number of nonzero links: 236 ## Percentage nonzero weights: 9.829238 ## Average number of links: 4.816327 The output tells you there are 49 tracts (polygons). Each tract is bordered by at least one other tract. The average number of neighbors is 4.8. The total number of neighbors over all tracts is 236. This represents 9.8% of all possible connections (if every tract is a neighbor of itself and every other tract 49 * 49). Note that this only works for spatial data frames. It will not work for a regular data frame where the spatial coordinates are defined as variables A graph of the tracts as nodes and neighbors as links is obtained with the plot() method. The arguments include the neighbor list object (here you assigned it the name nbs) and the location of the polygon centers, which are extracted from the simple feature data frame using the sf::st_centroid() plot(CC.sf$geometry) plot(nbs, sf::st_centroid(CC.sf$geometry), add = TRUE) The graph is a network showing the contiguity pattern (adjacency or neighbor structure). Tracts close to the center of the city have more neighboring tracts and thus more links in the network The number of links per tract (node)–link distribution–is obtained with the summary() method nbs |&gt; summary() ## Neighbour list object: ## Number of regions: 49 ## Number of nonzero links: 236 ## Percentage nonzero weights: 9.829238 ## Average number of links: 4.816327 ## Link number distribution: ## ## 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 5 9 12 5 9 3 4 1 1 ## 5 least connected regions: ## 1 6 42 46 47 with 2 links ## 1 most connected region: ## 20 with 10 links The list of neighboring tracts for the first two tracts. nbs[[1]] ## [1] 2 3 nbs[[2]] ## [1] 1 3 4 The first tract has two neighbors that include tracts 2 and 3. The neighbor numbers are stored as an integer vector within the nb object. Tract 2 has three neighbors that include tracts 1, 3, and 4. Tract 5 has 8 neighbors and so on. The function spdep::card() tallies the number of neighbors by tract spdep::card(nbs) ## [1] 2 3 4 4 8 2 4 6 8 4 5 6 4 6 6 8 3 4 3 10 3 6 3 7 8 ## [26] 6 4 9 7 5 3 4 4 4 7 5 6 6 3 5 3 2 6 5 4 2 2 4 3 Tract 5 has 8 neighbors and so on The next step toward computing spatial autocorrelation is to include weights to the neighbor list object indicating how ‘close’ each neighbor is. The function spdep::nb2listw() turns the neighbor list object into a spatial weights object. By default the weighting scheme gives each link the same weight equal to the multiplicative inverse of the number of neighbors wts &lt;- nbs |&gt; spdep::nb2listw() class(wts) ## [1] &quot;listw&quot; &quot;nb&quot; This wts object is a list with two elements.

Moran’s I follows the form of autocorrelation indexes where the similarity between regions \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) is proportional to the product of the deviations from the mean \\[ \\hbox{sim}_{ij} \\propto (Y_i - \\bar Y) (Y_j - \\bar Y) \\] where \\(i\\) indexes the region and \\(j\\) indexes the neighbors of \\(i\\). The value of \\(\\hbox{sim}_{ij}\\) is large when the \\(Y\\) values in the product are on the same side of their respective means (both above or below) and small when they are on opposite sides of their respective means (one above and one below or vice versa) The formula for I is \\[ \\hbox{I} = \\frac{N} {W} \\frac {\\sum_{i,j} w_{ij}(Y_i-\\bar Y) (Y_j-\\bar Y)} {\\sum_{i} (Y_i-\\bar Y)^2} \\] where \\(N\\) is the number regions, \\(w_{ij}\\) is the matrix of weights, and \\(W\\) is the sum over all weights Consider the following grid of cells containing attribute values if(!require(spatstat)) install.packages(pkgs = &quot;spatstat&quot;, repos = &quot;http://cran.us.r-project.org&quot;) ## Loading required package: spatstat ## Loading required package: spatstat.data ## Loading required package: spatstat.geom ## spatstat.geom 3.0-6 ## Loading required package: spatstat.random ## spatstat.random 3.1-3 ## Loading required package: spatstat.explore ## Loading required package: nlme ## spatstat.explore 3.0-6 ## Loading required package: spatstat.model ## Loading required package: rpart ## spatstat.model 3.1-2 ## Loading required package: spatstat.linnet ## spatstat.linnet 3.0-4 ## ## spatstat 3.0-3 ## For an introduction to spatstat, type &#39;beginner&#39; suppressMessages(library(spatstat)) set.seed(6750) Y &lt;- ppp(runif(200, 0, 1), runif(200, 0, 1)) plot(quadratcount(Y), main = &quot;&quot;) The formula for Moran’s I results in one value representing the magnitude of the autocorrelation (amount of clustering) over the entire area (global Moran’s I) First consider a single cell in the area (\\(N\\) = 1). Start with the middle cell (row 3, column 3). Let \\(i\\) = 3 in the above formula and let \\(j\\) index the cells touching the center cell in reading order starting with cell (2, 2), then cell (2, 3), etc Assume each neighbor is given a weight of 1/8 so \\(W = \\sum_{j=1}^8 w_j = 1\\). Then the value of I for the single center cell is I_{3, 3} = (6 - mean(y)) * ((8 - mean(y)) + (3 - mean(y)) + (9 - mean(y)) + (12 - mean(y)) + (10 - mean(y)) + (10 - mean(y)) + (9 - mean(y))) / (6 - mean(y))^2) y &lt;- c(3, 10, 7, 12, 5, 11, 8, 3, 9, 12, 6, 12, 6, 10, 3, 8, 10, 10, 9, 7, 5, 10, 8, 5, 11) ( yb &lt;- mean(y) ) ## [1] 8 Inum_i &lt;- (6 - yb) * ((8 - yb) + (3 - yb) + (9 - yb) + (12 - yb) + (10 - yb) + (10 - yb) + (10 - yb) + (9 - yb)) Iden_i &lt;- (6 - yb)^2 Inum_i/Iden_i ## [1] -3.5 The I value of -3.5 indicates that the center cell, which has a value below the average over all 25 cells, is mostly surrounded by cells having values above the average Now repeat this calculation for every cell and then take the sum over all the 25 I values This is what the function spdep::moran() from the {spdep} package does. The first argument is the vector containing the values for which you are interested in determining the magnitude of the spatial autocorrelation and the second argument is the listw object Further, you need to specify the number of regions and the sum of the weights S0. The latter is obtained from the spdep::Szero() function applied to the listw object Returning to the Columbus crime data here let m be the number of census tracts and s be the sum of the weights. You then apply the spdep::moran() function on the variable CRIME ( m &lt;- CC.sf$CRIME |&gt; length() ) ## [1] 49 ( s &lt;- wts |&gt; spdep::Szero() ) ## [1] 49 CC.sf$CRIME |&gt; spdep::moran(listw = wts, n = m, S0 = s) ## $I ## [1] 0.5001886 ## ## $K ## [1] 2.225946 The function returns the value of Moran’s I and the kurtosis (K) of the distribution of crime values. Moran’s I ranges from -1 to +1 The value of .5 for the crime rates indicates a high level of spatial autocorrelation. This is expected based on the clustering of crime in the central city Positive values of Moran’s I indicate clustering and negative values indicate inhibition. Inhibition is a process leading to nearby values having attribute values that are opposite in magnitude to those at each location (like a checkerboard pattern) Kurtosis is a statistic that indicates how peaked the distribution of the attribute values is. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. If the kurtosis is too large (or small) relative to a normal distribution then any statistical inference we make with Moran’s I will be suspect Read more about Moran’s I here Wikipedia Moran’s I Another statistic that indicates the amount of spatial autocorrelation is Geary’s C. The equation is \\[ \\hbox{C} = \\frac{(N-1) \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} (Y_i-Y_j)^2}{2 W \\sum_{i}(Y_i-\\bar Y)^2} \\] where \\(W\\) is the sum over all weights (\\(w_{ij}\\)) and \\(N\\) is the number of areas. The syntax of the spdep::geary() function is similar that of spdep::moran() except you also need to specify n1 as one minus the number of areas CC.sf$CRIME |&gt; spdep::geary(listw = wts, n = m, S0 = s, n1 = m - 1) ## $C ## [1] 0.5405282 ## ## $K ## [1] 2.225946 Values for Geary’s C range from 0 to 2 with 1 indicating no autocorrelation. Values less than 1 indicate positive autocorrelation. Both I and C are global measures of autocorrelation, but C is more sensitive to local variations in autocorrelation Rule of thumb: If the interpretation of Geary’s C is much different than the interpretation of Moran’s I then consider computing local indicators of autocorrelation (LISA) More information on Geary’s C statistic here Wikipedia Geary’s C Spatial lag and its relation to autocorrelation A deeper understanding of Moran’s I is obtained by noting that it is the slope coefficient resulting from a regression of the average neighborhood values onto the observed values. Averages of neighborhood values is called the spatial lag variable For example, let crime be the set of crime values (from the Columbus data) in each region as a data vector. You create a spatial lag variable using the spdep::lag.listw() function. The first argument is the listw object and the second is the vector of crime values crime &lt;- CC.sf$CRIME Wcrime &lt;- spdep::lag.listw(wts, crime) For each value in the vector crime there is a corresponding value in the vector Wcrime representing the average crime over the neighboring regions To verify, recall tract 1 had tract 2 and 3 as its two neighbors. So the following code should return a TRUE (crime[2] + crime[3])/2 == Wcrime[1] ## [1] TRUE The lagged value of crime in tract 1 is equal to the average of the crime in the two neighboring tracts Make a scatter plot showing individual observed crime rates on the horizontal axis and the corresponding neighborhood average crime rates on the vertical axis data.frame(crime, Wcrime) |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = crime, y = Wcrime)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 70)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 70)) + xlab(&quot;Crime&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Average crime in the neighborhood&quot;) + theme_minimal() ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; The range of neighborhood average crime rates is smaller than the range of observed crime rates since the mean of a set of observations will always have less variance (dispersion) than the observations The scatter plot shows that tracts with low values of crime tend to be surrounded by tracts with low values of crime on average and tracts with high values of crime tend be surrounded by tracts with high values of crime. The slope on the regression line is upward (positive) The magnitude of the slope is Moran’s I. To check this use the lm() function from the base set of packages. The function is used to fit linear regression models lm(Wcrime ~ crime) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Wcrime ~ crime) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) crime ## 17.4797 0.5002 The coefficient on the crime variable in the linear regression is .5 The scatter plot is called a ‘Moran’s scatter plot’ Let’s consider another spatial data set if(!&quot;sids2&quot; %in% list.files(here::here(&quot;data&quot;))) { download.file(&quot;http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/sids2.zip&quot;, destfile = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;sids2.zip&quot;)) unzip(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;sids2.zip&quot;), exdir = here::here(&quot;data&quot;)) } SIDS.sf &lt;- sf::st_read(dsn = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;sids2&quot;)) |&gt; sf::st_set_crs(4326) ## Reading layer `sids2&#39; from data source ## `/Users/jelsner/Desktop/ClassNotes/ASS-2023/data/sids2&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 100 features and 18 fields ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -84.32385 ymin: 33.88199 xmax: -75.45698 ymax: 36.58965 ## CRS: NA head(SIDS.sf) ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 18 fields ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -81.74107 ymin: 36.07282 xmax: -75.77316 ymax: 36.58965 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 ## AREA PERIMETER CNTY_ CNTY_ID NAME FIPS FIPSNO CRESS_ID BIR74 SID74 ## 1 0.114 1.442 1825 1825 Ashe 37009 37009 5 1091 1 ## 2 0.061 1.231 1827 1827 Alleghany 37005 37005 3 487 0 ## 3 0.143 1.630 1828 1828 Surry 37171 37171 86 3188 5 ## 4 0.070 2.968 1831 1831 Currituck 37053 37053 27 508 1 ## 5 0.153 2.206 1832 1832 Northampton 37131 37131 66 1421 9 ## 6 0.097 1.670 1833 1833 Hertford 37091 37091 46 1452 7 ## NWBIR74 BIR79 SID79 NWBIR79 SIDR74 SIDR79 NWR74 NWR79 ## 1 10 1364 0 19 0.916590 0.000000 9.165903 13.92962 ## 2 10 542 3 12 0.000000 5.535055 20.533881 22.14022 ## 3 208 3616 6 260 1.568381 1.659292 65.244668 71.90265 ## 4 123 830 2 145 1.968504 2.409639 242.125984 174.69879 ## 5 1066 1606 3 1197 6.333568 1.867995 750.175932 745.33001 ## 6 954 1838 5 1237 4.820937 2.720348 657.024793 673.01415 ## geometry ## 1 MULTIPOLYGON (((-81.47276 3... ## 2 MULTIPOLYGON (((-81.23989 3... ## 3 MULTIPOLYGON (((-80.45634 3... ## 4 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.00897 3... ## 5 MULTIPOLYGON (((-77.21767 3... ## 6 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.74506 3...

Variables in the simple feature data frame include police expenditures (POLICE), crime (CRIME), income (INC), unemployment (UNEMP) and other socio-economic characteristics across Mississippi at the county level.

Unemployment is percent of people looking for work in 1980 The geometries are polygons that define the county borders ggplot(data = PE.sf) + geom_sf() To estimate autocorrelation for any variable in the data frame, you need to first assign the neighbors and weights for each region The default options in the spdep::poly2nb() and spdep::nb2listw() result in neighbors defined by ‘queen’ contiguity (polygon intersections can include a single point) and weights defined by row standardization (the sum of the weights equals the number of regions) nbs &lt;- PE.sf |&gt; spdep::poly2nb() wts &lt;- nbs |&gt; spdep::nb2listw() Alternatively you can specify the number of neighbors and then assign neighbors based on proximity (closeness).

The nearest-neighbor defined neighborhoods have more links. Note: when neighbors are defined by proximity counties can share a border but they still may not be neighbors Your choice of neighbors is based on domain specific knowledge. If the process you are interested in can be described by a dispersal mechanism then proximity definition might be the right choice for defining neighbors. If the process can be described by a border diffusion mechanism then contiguity might be the right choice Create weight matrices for these alternative neighborhoods using the same spdep::nb2listw() function wts2 &lt;- nbs2 |&gt; spdep::nb2listw() wts3 &lt;- nbs3 |&gt; spdep::nb2listw() You compute Moran’s I for the percentage of white people variable (WHITE) with the moran() function separately for the three different weight matrices spdep::moran(PE.sf$WHITE, listw = wts, n = length(nbs), S0 = spdep::Szero(wts)) ## $I ## [1] 0.5634778 ## ## $K ## [1] 2.300738 spdep::moran(PE.sf$WHITE, listw = wts2, n = length(nbs2), S0 = spdep::Szero(wts2)) ## $I ## [1] 0.5506132 ## ## $K ## [1] 2.300738 spdep::moran(PE.sf$WHITE, listw = wts3, n = length(nbs3), S0 = spdep::Szero(wts3)) ## $I ## [1] 0.5592557 ## ## $K ## [1] 2.300738 Values of Moran’s I are constrained between -1 and +1. In this case the neighborhood definition has little or no impact on inferences made about spatial autocorrelation. The kurtosis is between 2 and 4 consistent with a set of values from a normal distribution In a similar way you compute the Geary’s C statistic spdep::geary(PE.sf$WHITE, listw = wts, n = length(nbs), S0 = spdep::Szero(wts), n1 = length(nbs) - 1) ## $C ## [1] 0.4123818 ## ## $K ## [1] 2.300738 Values of Geary’s C range between 0 and 2 with values less than one indicating positive autocorrelation If the values of Moran’s I and Geary’s C result in different interpretations about the amount of clustering then it is a good idea to examine local variations in autocorrelation.
